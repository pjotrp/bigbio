== ORF Prediction ==

The ORF 'predictor' is of the simple kind. It detects ORFs by
identifying start and stop signals in the same frame.

The main feature is that it does not consume real memory through the
use of a Sequence 'emitter', which scans a large input sequence and
yields open reading frames from STOP to STOP codon, with adjoining
nucleotides. This allows scanning the sequence in a *single* pass.

The input file maybe Fasta, as long as the reader yields chunks of
sequence data.
